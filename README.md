# Techpoint Sales Analysis | End-to-End Data Analytics Project

## Introduction
This project analyzes a hypothetical retail dataset for a fictional electronics store chain called TechPoint, performing end-to-end analytics using SQL, PowerBI and Python to calculate business KPIs and build visualizations across multiple tools.

## Contents
### 1. KPIs Calculated in SQL
- Total Sales
- Average Sales
- Number of Items Sold
- Average Rating

### 2. Granular Metrics in SQL
- Sales by Power Usage
- Sales by Item Type
- Power Usage by Total Sales
- Total Sales by Outlet Establishment

### 3. Chart Requirements in SQL
- Total Sales by Outlet Size
- Total Sales by Outlet Location
- All KPIs and Metrics broken down by Outlet Type

### 4. PowerBI Dashboard
Fully interactive dashboard with KPIs, category wise sales, trends over establishment years, outlet comparisons, and filter panels.

### 5. Python Analysis
Recalculated all SQL KPIs and metrics using pandas. Created visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn. Cross Validated insights found in SQL and Power BI.

## Outcome
Through this exploratory analysis we can acquire various insights such as:
- How various outlet characteristics (outlet size, location, type) influence sales performance.
- Which item categories and power usage levels drive revenue.
- How sales trends relate to establishments and their age.

The multi-tool cross validation also helps ensure consistency in reporting.

## Tools Used
- SQL (MSSQL)
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- PowerBI
- Google Colab
- Excel
